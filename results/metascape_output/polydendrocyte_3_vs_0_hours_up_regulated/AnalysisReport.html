      <h3>Gene Lists</h3>
      User-provided gene identifiers are first converted into their corresponding human Entrez gene IDs using the latest version of the database (last updated on 2024-01-101).  If multiple identifiers correspond to the same Entrez gene ID, they will be considered as a single Entrez gene ID in downstream analyses.   The gene lists are summarized in Table 1.<p/>

              <h3>Pathway and Process Enrichment Analysis</h3>
              For each given gene list, pathway and process enrichment analysis have been carried out with the following ontology sources: KEGG Pathway, GO Biological Processes, Reactome Gene Sets, Hallmark Gene Sets, Canonical Pathways, and CORUM.  All genes in the genome have been used as the enrichment background. Terms with a p-value &lt; 0.01, a minimum count of 3, and an enrichment factor &gt; 1.5 (the enrichment factor is the ratio between the observed counts and the counts expected by chance) are collected and grouped into clusters based on their membership similarities.  More specifically, p-values are calculated based on the cumulative hypergeometric distribution<sup>2</sup>, and q-values are calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to account for multiple testings<sup>3</sup>.  Kappa scores<sup>4</sup> are used as the similarity metric when performing hierarchical clustering on the enriched terms, and sub-trees with a similarity of > 0.3 are considered a cluster.  The most statistically significant term within a cluster is chosen to represent the cluster.<p/>

          <div class="panel-heading">Table 2. Top 2 clusters with their representative enriched terms (one per cluster).  "Count" is the number of genes in the user-provided lists with membership in the given ontology term. "%" is the percentage of all of the user-provided genes that are found in the given ontology term (only input genes with at least one ontology term annotation are included in the calculation).  "Log10(P)" is the p-value in log base 10.  "Log10(q)" is the multi-test adjusted p-value in log base 10.</div>

                  To further capture the relationships between the terms, a subset of enriched terms has been selected and rendered as a network plot, where terms with a similarity &gt; 0.3 are connected by edges.  We select the terms with the best p-values from each of the 20 clusters, with the constraint that there are no more than 15 terms per cluster and no more than 250 terms in total.  The network is visualized using <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org">Cytoscape</a><sup>5</sup>, where each node represents an enriched term and is colored first by its cluster ID (Figure 2.a) and then by its p-value (Figure 2.b).  These networks can be interactively viewed in Cytoscape through the .cys files (contained in the Zip package, which also contains a publication-quality version as a PDF) or within a browser by clicking on the web icon.  For clarity, term labels are only shown for one term per cluster, so it is recommended to use Cytoscape or a browser to visualize the network in order to inspect all node labels.  We can also export the network into a PDF file within Cytoscape, and then edit the labels using Adobe Illustrator for publication purposes.  To switch off all labels, delete the "Label" mapping under the "Style" tab within Cytoscape, and then export the network view.<p/>

<h3>Protein-protein Interaction Enrichment Analysis</h3>
For each given gene list, protein-protein interaction enrichment analysis has been carried out with the following databases: STRING<sup>6</sup>, BioGrid<sup>7</sup>, OmniPath<sup>8</sup>, InWeb_IM<sup>9</sup>.Only physical interactions in STRING (physical score &gt 0.132) and BioGrid are used (<a href="http://metascape.org/blog/?p=219">details</a>).  The resultant network contains the subset of proteins that form physical interactions with at least one other member in the list.  If the network contains between 3 and 500 proteins, the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) algorithm<sup>10</sup> has been applied to identify densely connected network components.
